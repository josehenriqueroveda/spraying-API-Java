# 🌱 Spraying API - Java

## 🚜 What is the importance of spraying in agriculture?

Spraying is of fundamental importance in agriculture, being responsible for protecting crops against pests, diseases, insects and making nutrients available to plants, ensuring good productivity. This API aims to assist in the analysis of climatic conditions in real time, to inform whether these conditions are suitable or not for agricultural spraying.

## 💻 About this API:

This API was built with [Spring](https://spring.io/). 
Spring makes programming Java quicker, easier, and safer for everybody. Spring’s focus on speed, simplicity, and productivity has made it the world's most popular Java framework.

☁️ **Where did climate data come from before analysis?**
The wheather data come from OpenWeatherMap, it is an online service, owned by OpenWeather Ltd, that provides global weather data, including current weather data, forecasts, nowcasts and historical data, utilising meteorological broadcast services and raw data from airport weather stations, radar stations and other weather stations. After receiving the meteorological data, the API performs the processing, returning the spray conditions

## Examples

* In this case, the city of Jaborandi is in good condition for spraying. 🌿

* Londrina is not in a good condition for agricultural spraying due to the high wind speed, which causes drift. 💨
